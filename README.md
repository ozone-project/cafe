# CAFE - Content Access Fair Exchange

A complete solution for fair content licensing and distribution, including both the business presentation and a working prototype dashboard.

## üìñ About CAFE

**Content Access Fair Exchange (CAFE)** addresses the fundamental problem of declining referral traffic from search engines and social platforms to content creators. As search referrals have dropped from 90% to 41.5% over 14 years, CAFE provides a new model for fair content access and compensation.

### The Problem
- **Broken Referral Model**: Platforms consume content but provide fewer referrals back
- **Unauthorized Scraping**: Bots extract content without compensation  
- **Revenue Loss**: Publishers lose control over their content distribution
- **Compliance Issues**: Data collectors lack proper licensing frameworks

### The CAFE Solution
- **Anti-Scraping Technology**: Advanced bot detection and prevention
- **Licensing Framework**: Task-specific data use permissions and restrictions  
- **Data API**: Controlled access interface for authorized users
- **Fair Compensation**: Publishers get paid for content usage vs. referrals
- **Security & Compliance**: Built-in data protection and regulatory compliance

## üìä Presentation Slides

This repository contains a comprehensive slide deck explaining the CAFE concept, market opportunity, and technical architecture.
