## CAFE Value Proposition

Content Access Fair Exchange addresses the needs of all four quadrants by providing:

- **Scalable licensing** for any content owner size
- **Flexible access controls** for any consumer size  
- **Standardized protocols** that work across the ecosystem
- **Fair value exchange** regardless of participant size

## Key Benefits

| **Cross-Market Solution** | Works from self-service to bespoke negotiations |
| **Technology Platform** | Ozzie provides the implementation infrastructure |
| **Industry Adoption** | Like RTB, designed for broad ecosystem participation |

## The CAFE Difference

Unlike current ad-hoc solutions, CAFE provides a comprehensive framework that standardizes content access while maintaining flexibility for different market needs.
