# The Broken Promise

The original implicit agreement between content creators and platforms was simple:

    Publishers -->|Provide Free Content| Platforms

```

### Referrals from Search Engines

The Search engines used to refer 90% of searches to publishers.  Now, less than a third of searches results in a referral.

```mermaid

    x-axis [2010, 2016, 2024]
    y-axis "Search Traffic PCT Publisher Referrals" 0 --> 100
    line [90, 56.1, 41.5]
```

### Referrals from Social Media and Video

Social Media and Video display a similar downward trend.

```mermaid

    title "PCT of Referral Traffic from Social Media"
    x-axis [2018, 2020, 2023, 2024]
    y-axis "Publisher Traffic PCT Social" 0 --> 35
    line [32, 15, 6.4, 4]
```

### AI Platform Impact: AI Refers Agents, not Humans

AI platforms consume content at unprecedented scale.  However, AI (particularly Claude) does not refer Human traffic, but rather deploys Agents to read and process content. While this is valuable, there needs to be another monetisation method for content owners.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Bots-to-Humans Ratio"
    x-axis ["Google", "ChatGPT", "Claude"]
    y-axis "Bot Scrapes per Human Referral" 0 --> 75000

```
