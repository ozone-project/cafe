# Claude Context - Data License Slide Deck Project

## Project Purpose
This project is creating a presentation slide deck for a new data protection and licensing system. The system aims to solve the problem of unauthorized web scraping while providing controlled access to data through proper licensing.

## System Overview
The proposed technology solution includes:

### Core Problems Being Solved
- Unauthorized bot scraping of website content
- Lack of control over data usage and licensing
- Need for legitimate users to access data through proper channels
- Revenue loss from uncontrolled data extraction

### Proposed Solution Components
1. **Anti-Scraping Technology**: Advanced detection and prevention of unauthorized bots
2. **Licensing Framework**: Task-specific permissions that restrict data use to approved activities
3. **Data API**: Controlled access interface for authorized users to obtain data legally
4. **Security & Compliance**: Built-in data protection and regulatory compliance features

## Final System Naming
**Content Access Framework (CAF)** powered by **Ozzie** (Ozone Zone Interface Engine)

- **CAF**: Industry standard protocol for content access and licensing (avoids DRM connotations)
- **Ozzie**: Technology platform implementing CAF across multiple companies/zones
- Similar to how RTB works as an industry standard with various platform implementations

## Technical Approach
- Using Mermaid diagrams for technical architecture and data flow illustrations
- Creating individual slide files that can be connected into a cohesive presentation
- Focus on visual communication of complex technical concepts

## Target Audience
Content owners, data collectors, technical decision makers, and business stakeholders who need to understand the value proposition and technical feasibility of implementing this data protection system.
