# Direct Traffic in Decline, Driven by Lower Referrals

<br/>

```mermaid
graph LR
    Publishers -->|Free Content| Platforms
    Platforms -->|Referrals| Publishers
    
    linkStyle 1 stroke:darkred,stroke-width:2px
```

<br/>

#### • Platforms keep users on their site longer, therefore lower referrals
#### • Users can read content on platforms, no need to navigate to publisher directly

<br/><br/><br/>

## Referrals from Search Engines

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "PCT Publisher Referrals from Search"
    x-axis [2010, 2016, 2024]
    y-axis "PCT Referrals" 0 --> 100
    line [90, 56.1, 41.5]
```

<br/>

#### • Zero click searches have increased significantly over the last 10 years
#### • Even though search continues to grow, the percentage of search users that navigate to a publisher continues to decrease


<br/><br/><br/>

## Referrals from Social Media

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "PCT Social Media Referrals to Publisher"
    x-axis [2018, 2020, 2023, 2024]
    y-axis "PCT Referrals" 0 --> 100
    line [32, 15, 6.4, 4]
```

###### *Note: Graph generated from AI research of many sources.  Direct citation needed*

<br/>

#### • Referrals from Social media have never been as good as search
#### • Regardless referrals continue to decline as Social platforms try harder to keep traffic on their own site


<br/><br/><br/>

### Referrals are Increasingly Not Human

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Human vs Bot Referrals by Platform PCT"
    x-axis ["Search", "Social", "Video", "AI"]
    y-axis "Percentage" 0 --> 100
    bar [100, 100, 100, 100]
    bar [30, 20, 5, 0.1]
```
