# Data License Slide Deck

A presentation deck for a new data protection and licensing system that prevents unauthorized web scraping and provides controlled API access to content.

## Project Overview

This slide deck presents a comprehensive solution for content owners to protect their data from unauthorized scraping while providing legitimate users with controlled access through a licensing framework and Data API.

## System Components

The proposed system includes:

- **Anti-Scraping Technology**: Advanced bot detection and prevention
- **Licensing Framework**: Task-specific data use permissions and restrictions
- **Data API**: Controlled access interface for authorized users
- **Security & Compliance**: Data protection and regulatory compliance features

## Final System Naming

**Content Access Framework (CAF)** powered by **Ozzie** (Ozone Zone Interface Engine)

- **CAF**: The industry standard protocol for content access and licensing
- **Ozzie**: The technology platform that implements the CAF standard

## Slide Deck Structure (19 slides)

1. Title Slide - Introducing CAF (Content Access Framework)
2. Data Leakage Commoditizes Content Owners - Current state of unauthorized data collection
3. Implicit Value Exchange - User referrals as a trade for content access have eroded over time
4. Market Landscape - 2x2 matrix: Big/Small Content Owners vs Big/Small Data Collectors
5. Introducing CAF - Overview of the Content Access Framework
6. Core Components - Bot detection, licensing engine, and Data API (Ozzie)
7. System Architecture - High-level technical diagram for push and pull models
8. Content Data - Overview of what additional data elements are included with a piece of content
9. Licensing Framework - Task-specific data use permissions
10. Data API Access - Controlled access for authorized users
11. Business Models - Business model options for charging for input (content) vs output (users)
12. Next Steps - Call to action and implementation path
13. Stakeholers and responsibilites

## Tools Used

- Mermaid diagrams for technical illustrations
- Markdown for slide content
- Various visualization tools for data flow and architecture diagrams

## Status

This is a presentation deck project focused on communicating the value and technical approach of a new data protection and licensing system.
