# Content Access Fair Exchange Slide Deck

A presentation deck for a new data protection and licensing system that prevents unauthorized web scraping and provides controlled API access to content.

## Project Overview

This slide deck presents a comprehensive solution for content owners to protect their data from unauthorized usage while providing humans and legitimate data consumers with controlled access through a licensing framework and Data API.

## The Problem: The Broken Referral Model

Historical research shows a dramatic decline in referral traffic from search engines to content creators:

- **2010**: ~90% of Google searches resulted in clicks to external websites
- **2024**: Only 41.5% of searches result in clicks to external websites
- **Impact**: A 54% relative decrease in referral potential over 14 years

This broken promise - where platforms gained free content but stopped sending proportional traffic back - necessitates a new model for fair content access and compensation.

## System Components

The proposed system includes:

- **Anti-Scraping Technology**: Advanced bot detection and prevention
- **Licensing Framework**: Task-specific data use permissions and restrictions
- **Data API**: Controlled access interface for authorized users
- **Security & Compliance**: Data protection and regulatory compliance features

## Final System Naming

**Content Access Fair Exchange (CAFE)**

- **CAFE**: The industry standard protocol for content access and fair licensing exchange
